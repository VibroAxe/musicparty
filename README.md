# Music Party

## Introduction

A collaborative party music jukebox using Spotify.

## Planned Features

This is still a VERY early alpha, with about 6 days dev work on it. It is barely functional and doesn't have any features like deleting upcoming tracks.

The following features are planned:

 - TV Mode
 - A UI that actually looks good and is usable - Getting there!
 - Extra description/messaging
 - Much better descriptions
 - User banning/limiting
 - Allow/Deny lists for tracks, albums, etc.
 - Export playback history to another playlist
 - Discord role/presence verification
 - Automatic Playlist Reinitialisation
 - Autoplay Mode - forces playback on the specified device
 - Spotify Controls

## Installation

An example deployment in production would be something like this for a `.env` file.

```

HOSTNAME=musicparty.example.com
PROTOCOL=http://
PORT=80


APP_URL=${PROTOCOL}${HOSTNAME}
#App key should be any valid, either use php to generate this or https://generate-random.org/laravel-key-generator
APP_KEY=


DB_DATABASE=musicparty
DB_USERNAME=musicparty
#Add you own dbpassword here for security
DB_PASSWORD=

#
PUSHER_APP_KEY=musicparty
#Generate a new secret here using?
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=
#
MIX_PUSHER_CLIENT_HOSTNAME=${HOSTNAME}
MIX_PUSHER_CLIENT_PORT=${PORT}

#Create two new apps from spotify.
#You will need to set the redirect uri to ${PROTOCOL}${HOSTNAME}/auth/spotify/search/redirect when you create them
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=

SPOTIFY_SEARCH_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_SEARCH_CLIENT_SECRET=
SPOTIFY_SEARCH_REDIRECT_URI=${APP_URL}/auth/spotify/search/redirect
SPOTIFY_SEARCH_REFRESH_TOKEN=

#Create a new discord app at https://discord.com/developers/applications
#Set the redirect uri in the OAuth2 settings to ${PROTOCOL}${HOSTNAME}/auth/spotify/search/redirect
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
#OAuth2 Secret from the OAuth2 settings in Discord
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=

```

The defaults for other env settings are based on a docker setup similar to the one below and for running in production.

You would then a docker-compose something like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
    nginx:
        image: ghcr.io/mintopia/musicparty-nginx:develop
        ports:
            - ${PORT}:80
        restart: unless-stopped
        depends_on:
            - php-fpm

    php-fpm:
        image: ghcr.io/mintopia/musicparty-php-fpm:develop
        env_file: .env
        restart: unless-stopped
        depends_on:
            - db
            - redis

    scheduler:
        image: ghcr.io/mintopia/musicparty-php-fpm:develop
        entrypoint: [ "php" ]
        command: "artisan schedule:work"
        user: "1000"
        env_file: .env
        restart: unless-stopped
        depends_on:
            - db
            - redis

    worker:
        image: ghcr.io/mintopia/musicparty-php-fpm:develop
        entrypoint: [ "php" ]
        command: "artisan queue:work"
        user: "1000"
        env_file: .env
        restart: unless-stopped
        scale: 2
        depends_on:
            - db
            - redis

    websockets:
        image: ghcr.io/mintopia/musicparty-php-fpm:develop
        ports:
            - 6001:6001
        entrypoint: [ "php" ]
        command: "artisan websockets:serve"
        user: "1000"
        env_file: .env
        restart: unless-stopped
        depends_on:
            - db
            - redis

    artisan:
        image: ghcr.io/mintopia/musicparty-php-fpm:develop
        entrypoint: [ "php", "artisan" ]
        user: "1000"
        env_file: .env
        depends_on:
            - db
            - redis
        profiles:
            - artisan

    redis:
        image: redis:6.0
        restart: unless-stopped

    db:
        image: mariadb:10.5-focal
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "${DB_PASSWORD}"
            MYSQL_DATABASE: "${DB_DATABASE}"
            MYSQL_USER: "${DB_USERNAME}"
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: "${DB_PASSWORD}"
        volumes:
            - dbdata:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
    dbdata:
        driver: local
```

Run the stack with `docker-compose up -d` and the DB migrations using `docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate`.

## Usage

When it's running, it will create a managed Spotify playlist called something like `Spotify Party - ABCD`. Start playing this playlist and it'll handle the rest.

## Known Issues

After a while, Spotify stops updating the Playlist on clients - the playlist is updated, but the clients don't get told the changes. When this happens, the only way to resolve it is to create a new playlist. You can do this using `docker-compose run --rm artisan party:fixplaylist <code>`.

## Development

I'm terrible at UI/UX, if anyone would like to contribute to make this look good and knows Vue/Blade/Laravel, please dive in and help. Collaboration is on the UK LAN Techs discord.

There is a docker-compose and compose files for running a dev environment with the source code bind mounted. You can bring up the stack by doing the following:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Edit `.env` as appropriate
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Run `docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate` to run DB migrations

By default the stack will now be running on `http://localhost:port`.

A full set of typical PHP development tools are defined in docker-compose and can be run using the `docker-compose run --rm <tool>` syntax, eg. `artisan`, `composer`, `phpunit`.

## Thanks

This would not exist without the support of the following:

- UK LAN Techs
- Jason 'Mohero' Rivers
- Chris 'Cheez' Stretton
- Development Team Serenity at Fasthosts for the PHP build environment images
